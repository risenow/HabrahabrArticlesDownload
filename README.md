Scipt that allows you to download all articles from habr.com in .txt format

**You can use it as follows:**
   `python.exe miner.py -b "begin" -e "end"`
  
, the script will download articles starting with indexes from ***"begin"*** to ***"end"*** and save it to the *"articles"* folder(which it'll create if such is absent).
